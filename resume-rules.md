# Resume Tailoring Rules

## Personal Constraints

Strict Source Adherence: Never invent major hard skills (languages, frameworks, degrees). However, if the job description emphasizes specific soft skills or general competencies (e.g., "Project Management," "Cross-functional Collaboration"), the AI may incorporate these into bullet points or a skills summary if they align with the spirit of the experience.

Core Integrity: Never remove or alter my Education section, LinkedIn URL, or my professional certifications.

Identity Formatting: Always keep my name formatted as [First M. Last].

Relevance Filter: Every skill or achievement added must directly map to a requirement in the job description. Do not include irrelevant hobbies or unrelated past experiences.

Employment Dates: Never alter start/end dates for any position.

## Tailoring Strategy

Keyword Mirroring: Identify the top 5 technical skills and 3 soft skills from the job description. Ensure these exact terms appear in the "Professional Summary" and "Skills" sections.

ATS-Friendly Headers: Use only standard section titles: Work Experience, Education, Skills, and Projects. Avoid creative titles like "My Journey" or "Expertise."

Bullet Point Density: Limit each bullet point to a maximum of 2 lines. If a point is longer, break it into two distinct achievements.

Standard Categorization: Organize the "Skills" section into sub-categories (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Tools) to help AI parsers categorize your expertise correctly.

Reverse Chronological Order: Always maintain a strict reverse-chronological order for the work experience section.

Date Consistency: Use "Month YYYY" (e.g., "January 2023") or "MM/YYYY" (e.g., "01/2023") format consistently throughout the entire resume. Always include months — year-only dates reduce ATS parsing accuracy. Never mix formats within the same document.

Contact Information: Place all contact details (name, phone, email, LinkedIn URL, city/state) in the main document body, never in headers, footers, or text boxes. Display the LinkedIn URL as visible text.

## Phase 3: High-Impact Expansion & ATS Alignment

### Verb Bank (Required Usage)

When rewriting bullet points, prioritize the following verbs. Match the verb category to the nature of the requirement in the JD. Within each category, verbs are ordered by impact strength. Prefer verbs signaling ownership and scale (listed first) over participation verbs (listed last).

- **Leadership:** Spearheaded, Championed, Directed, Orchestrated, Navigated, Galvanized, Delegated, Mentored, Cultivated, Facilitated
- **Technical:** Architected, Engineered, Deployed, Automated, Modernized, Refactored, Optimized, Integrated, Standardized, Debugged
- **Analytical:** Deciphered, Audited, Forecasted, Discovered, Evaluated, Validated, Investigated, Identified, Interpreted, Reconciled
- **Communication:** Negotiated, Influenced, Persuaded, Authored, Presented, Advised, Consulted, Mediated, Clarified, Collaborated
- **Impact/Results:** Pioneered, Transformed, Generated, Launched, Exceeded, Accelerated, Maximized, Secured, Revitalized, Reduced

### Expansion Instructions

1. **Extract JD Context:** Identify the "Power Verbs" used in the Job Description. If the JD uses "Builds," the resume should use "Architected" or "Spearheaded."

2. **The XYZ Formula:** Every expanded bullet point MUST follow this structure:
   Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].

3. **Keyword Injection:** Scan the JD for technical nouns (e.g., "Python," "AWS," "Agile"). Infiltrate these words into the descriptions of past projects even if they weren't the "main" focus, provided it remains truthful to existing skills.

4. **Bullet Point Refinement:**
   - Remove ALL "Responsible for..." or "Tasked with..." phrases.
   - Every bullet point MUST start with a verb from the Verb Bank.
   - Limit to 2 lines per bullet to ensure ATS readability and human scannability.

### ATS Optimization Logic

1. **Keyword Density & Placement:** Ensure the top 5 technical skills from the JD appear 2-3 times across different sections with natural contextual variation. Follow the placement hierarchy: headline/title (highest weight) > professional summary > skills section > experience bullets > education. The first mention in each section provides the most ATS scoring value. Never exceed 3 mentions of any single term — keyword density above ~3% per term risks triggering stuffing detection. Target overall keyword density of 1.5-2.2% of total resume word count.

2. **Mirroring:** If the JD lists "Collaboration with Stakeholders," do NOT change it to "Talking to clients." Use the JD's exact terminology to ensure the parser flags a direct match.

3. **Quantifiable Fluff:** If a soft skill is required (e.g., "Leadership"), expand an existing bullet point to include the impact of that leadership (e.g., "...resulting in a 15% increase in team velocity").

### Final Quality Check

Before returning the tailored resume, verify:
1. The tailored version has a significantly higher keyword match than the original.
2. All "hallucination" constraints from the Personal Constraints section are strictly followed.
3. Every bullet point leads with a high-impact verb from the Verb Bank.
4. The XYZ formula (Accomplished X, measured by Y, by doing Z) is applied to every experience bullet.

## User Override Clause
If post-generation feedback is provided during iterative refinement, the AI is permitted to deviate from standard templates and formatting rules to accommodate the user's personal voice, sign-off preferences, and custom phrasing. Factual grounding constraints (no fabricated skills, credentials, or metrics) still apply.
