# Resume Tailoring Rules

## Personal Constraints

Strict Source Adherence: Never invent major hard skills (languages, frameworks, degrees). However, if the job description emphasizes specific soft skills or general competencies (e.g., "Project Management," "Cross-functional Collaboration"), the AI may incorporate these into bullet points or a skills summary if they align with the spirit of the experience.

Core Integrity: Never remove or alter my Education section, LinkedIn URL, or my professional certifications.

Identity Formatting: Always keep my name formatted as [First M. Last].

Relevance Filter: Every skill or achievement added must directly map to a requirement in the job description. Do not include irrelevant hobbies or unrelated past experiences.

Employment Dates: Never alter start/end dates for any position.

## Content Selection

The primary job of tailoring is SELECTING and TRIMMING, not rewriting everything. A focused resume that only includes JD-relevant content will always outperform a bloated resume with synonyms swapped in.

Trimming Philosophy: Start by deciding what to REMOVE. For each role, ask: "Does this role demonstrate skills the JD requires?" If not, cut it entirely. For each bullet within a kept role, ask: "Is this one of the 2 strongest bullets for this JD?" If not, cut it.

Role Budget: Maximum 3-4 roles in the Experience section. Cut older or irrelevant roles entirely rather than summarizing them.

Bullet Budget: 2 bullets per role. Pick the 2 that best demonstrate JD-required skills or outcomes. Do not rewrite every bullet from the base resume.

Section Pruning: Remove entire sections (Projects, Volunteer, Awards) if they do not directly serve the target JD. Every section must earn its place.

Page Target: 400-500 words total for a 1-page resume. This is a hard constraint.

## Tailoring Strategy

Keyword Selection: Identify the top 5 technical skills and 3 soft skills from the job description. Achieve keyword coverage by selecting bullets that already contain or naturally support these terms. Place JD keywords by choosing the right content, not by injecting terms into every sentence.

ATS-Friendly Headers: Use only standard section titles: Work Experience, Education, Skills, and Projects. Avoid creative titles like "My Journey" or "Expertise."

Bullet Point Density: Limit each bullet point to a maximum of 2 lines. If a point is longer, break it into two distinct achievements.

Standard Categorization: Organize the "Skills" section into sub-categories (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Tools) to help AI parsers categorize your expertise correctly.

Reverse Chronological Order: Always maintain a strict reverse-chronological order for the work experience section.

Date Consistency: Use "Month YYYY" (e.g., "January 2023") or "MM/YYYY" (e.g., "01/2023") format consistently throughout the entire resume. Always include months — year-only dates reduce ATS parsing accuracy. Never mix formats within the same document.

Contact Information: Place all contact details (name, phone, email, LinkedIn URL, city/state) in the main document body, never in headers, footers, or text boxes. Display the LinkedIn URL as visible text.

## Phase 3: High-Impact Refinement & ATS Alignment

### Verb Bank (Required Usage)

When rewriting bullet points, prioritize the following verbs. Match the verb category to the nature of the requirement in the JD. Within each category, verbs are ordered by impact strength. Prefer verbs signaling ownership and scale (listed first) over participation verbs (listed last).

- **Leadership:** Spearheaded, Championed, Directed, Orchestrated, Navigated, Galvanized, Delegated, Mentored, Cultivated, Facilitated
- **Technical:** Architected, Engineered, Deployed, Automated, Modernized, Refactored, Optimized, Integrated, Standardized, Debugged
- **Analytical:** Deciphered, Audited, Forecasted, Discovered, Evaluated, Validated, Investigated, Identified, Interpreted, Reconciled
- **Communication:** Negotiated, Influenced, Persuaded, Authored, Presented, Advised, Consulted, Mediated, Clarified, Collaborated
- **Impact/Results:** Pioneered, Transformed, Generated, Launched, Exceeded, Accelerated, Maximized, Secured, Revitalized, Reduced

### Refinement Instructions

1. **Extract JD Context:** Identify the "Power Verbs" used in the Job Description. If the JD uses "Builds," the resume should use "Architected" or "Spearheaded."

2. **The XYZ Formula:** Prefer the structure "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]" when natural and when real metrics exist. However, a short punchy bullet that clearly demonstrates a JD-required skill is always better than a padded XYZ bullet. Do not force every bullet into this format.

3. **Keyword Selection:** Place JD keywords by choosing the right bullets to keep, not by injecting terms into every sentence. If a bullet naturally contains a JD keyword, that is better than rewriting a different bullet to artificially include it.

4. **Bullet Point Refinement:**
   - Remove ALL "Responsible for..." or "Tasked with..." phrases.
   - Every bullet point MUST start with a verb from the Verb Bank.
   - Limit to 2 lines per bullet to ensure ATS readability and human scannability.

### ATS Optimization Logic

1. **Keyword Density & Placement:** Ensure the top 5 technical skills from the JD appear 2-3 times across different sections with natural contextual variation. Follow the placement hierarchy: headline/title (highest weight) > professional summary > skills section > experience bullets > education. The first mention in each section provides the most ATS scoring value. Never exceed 3 mentions of any single term — keyword density above ~3% per term risks triggering stuffing detection. Target overall keyword density of 1.5-2.2% of total resume word count.

2. **Mirroring:** If the JD lists "Collaboration with Stakeholders," do NOT change it to "Talking to clients." Use the JD's exact terminology to ensure the parser flags a direct match.

3. **Quantifiable Outcomes:** If a soft skill is required (e.g., "Leadership"), select a bullet that already demonstrates that skill with concrete outcomes. Do not fabricate metrics — use only numbers from the base resume.

### Final Quality Check

Before returning the tailored resume, verify:
1. The output is 400-500 words (1 page) with 2 bullets per role and maximum 3-4 roles.
2. All "hallucination" constraints from the Personal Constraints section are strictly followed.
3. Every bullet point leads with a high-impact verb from the Verb Bank.
4. Irrelevant roles and sections have been removed, not just summarized.

## User Override Clause
If post-generation feedback is provided during iterative refinement, the AI is permitted to deviate from standard templates and formatting rules to accommodate the user's personal voice, sign-off preferences, and custom phrasing. Factual grounding constraints (no fabricated skills, credentials, or metrics) still apply.
