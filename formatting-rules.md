# Formatting Rules for ATS Compatibility

## File Format
- Save as .docx for maximum ATS compatibility (~95% parse success rate)
- Text-based PDF is acceptable but slightly riskier (~85% parse success)
- NEVER submit image-based PDFs, scanned documents, .pages, .odt, or .jpg/.png
- File size: under 200KB for PDF, under 300KB for DOCX
- File name: FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf (no spaces or special characters)

## Layout
- Single-column layout ONLY — multi-column layouts cause reading-order confusion in ATS parsers
- Never use tables to structure resume content
- Never use text boxes or floating elements
- No sidebar columns for skills or contact info

## Typography
- Standard system fonts only: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Georgia, Verdana, Helvetica
- Maximum 2 font families per document
- No decorative, script, handwriting, or custom fonts
- Font size: 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for name, 11-13pt for section headings

## Special Characters & Bullets
- Use standard bullets only: • (bullet) or - (dash)
- Never use: ★ ✓ → ▸ ♦ or any emoji
- Avoid decorative dividers or horizontal rules
- Smart/curly quotes may cause issues — use straight quotes when possible

## Graphics & Visual Elements
- ATS CANNOT read text inside images, icons, infographics, logos, or skill bars
- Never display skills as progress bars, star ratings, or pie charts
- Express proficiency in words: "Python — Expert" not a 4/5 star graphic
- Remove all headshot photos

## Contact Information
- Place ALL contact info in the document body — never in headers or footers
- 25% of resumes fail contact info extraction when placed in headers/footers
- Include: full name, phone, email, LinkedIn URL (as visible text), city/state
- LinkedIn URL should be displayed as text (linkedin.com/in/username), not hidden behind a hyperlink

## Headers & Footers
- ATS parsers typically skip header and footer content entirely
- Never place critical information (name, phone, email, skills) in document headers/footers
- Page numbers in footers are acceptable but not indexed

## Date Formatting
- Use consistent format throughout: "Month YYYY" or "MM/YYYY"
- Always include months — year-only dates reduce parsing accuracy
- Never mix formats (e.g., "Jan 2023" and "January 2024" in the same document)
- 37% of resumes are rejected for unreadable date formats

## Document Metadata
- Set the document Title field to: "[Your Name] – [Job Title] Resume"
- Set the Author field to your full name
- Add top 5-8 technical skills as document Keywords
- Some ATS index metadata fields — this is a free optimization

## File Name
- Format: FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf or FirstName_LastName_Resume.docx
- No spaces, special characters, or version numbers in the file name
- Do not use generic names like "resume.pdf" or "final_v3.docx"
