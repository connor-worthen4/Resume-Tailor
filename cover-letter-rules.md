# Cover Letter Rules

## Hook Strategy
Open with a specific, compelling hook that demonstrates genuine knowledge of the company. Reference a recent achievement, product launch, mission statement, or industry position that resonates with your experience. Never open with "I am writing to apply for..." or similar generic openers.

## Enthusiasm & Alignment
Show authentic enthusiasm for the role and company. Connect your career trajectory to the company's mission or the team's goals. Demonstrate that you understand what the company does and why this role matters to them.

## Tone
Write in a professional but conversational tone. Avoid overly formal language ("I humbly submit...") and AI-isms ("I am excited to leverage my synergies..."). Sound like a real human who is genuinely interested in the position. Use first person naturally.

Avoid these specific AI-generated phrases: "I am passionate about...," "I thrive in...," "I bring a unique blend of...," "In today's fast-paced...," "proven track record" (without immediate proof), "results-driven professional," "dynamic environment," "hit the ground running," "value-add," "cutting-edge," "best-in-class," "world-class." These are commonly flagged by recruiters as AI-generated language.

## Evidence Over Claims
Every claim must be backed by a specific example from the candidate's actual experience. Instead of "I am a strong leader," write "At [Company], I led a team of 8 engineers through a 6-month platform migration." Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) implicitly without labeling it.

## Pain Point Analysis
Identify the top 2-3 "pain points" from the job description — the core problems this role is being hired to solve. Structure the body of the cover letter around how your experience directly addresses these pain points. Each paragraph should map to a specific need.

## Call to Action
Close with a confident, specific call to action. Express eagerness to discuss how your experience maps to their needs. Avoid passive closings like "I hope to hear from you." Instead, use forward-looking language: "I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with [X] can help [Company] achieve [Y]."

## Keyword Reinforcement
Naturally weave 3-5 of the job description's highest-priority technical keywords into the cover letter narrative. These should appear within achievement descriptions (not as standalone lists) and must reference only skills present in the candidate's base resume. The cover letter provides a supplementary keyword boost — it reinforces the resume's top keywords rather than serving as a separate optimization target.

## Formatting
- Keep to 3-4 paragraphs maximum (approximately 250-400 words)
- The cover letter should flow as prose by default — no bullet points. Exception: if the user's cover letter template explicitly includes bullet points in the body, a brief set of 2-3 achievement bullets may be used. Otherwise, always default to prose paragraphs.
- Do not repeat the resume verbatim; instead, tell the story behind 2-3 key achievements
- Address the hiring manager by name if available, otherwise use "Dear Hiring Team"

## Strict Constraints
- Never fabricate experiences, companies, or achievements
- Only reference skills, tools, and technologies that exist in the candidate's base resume
- Do not invent metrics or percentages not present in the original resume
- Maintain the candidate's authentic voice — do not use phrases the candidate would never say

## User Override Clause
If post-generation feedback is provided during iterative refinement, the AI is permitted to deviate from standard templates and formatting rules to accommodate the user's personal voice, sign-off preferences, and custom phrasing. Factual grounding constraints (no fabricated experiences or metrics) still apply.
